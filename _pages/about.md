_He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast._

**- Leonardo Da Vinci**

## About Me

I am a [Data Science MSc. Student](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-ds.html) in the [Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch). I am particularly interested in applications and theory of single/multi-agent reinforcement learning, game theory, (Bayesian) optimization and broadly, machine learning. I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) for my thesis. I am also lucky to be a part of [Social Networks Lab](https://sn.ethz.ch) as a research assistant, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ulrik Brandes](https://sn.ethz.ch/profile.html?persid=239462). 

Previously, I graduated in June 2020 from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), where I did my bachelors in the [Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/). During my bachelors, for my electives, I took courses that were directed towards machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning and microeconomics.
